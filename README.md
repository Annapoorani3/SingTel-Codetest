# SingTel-Codetest
Java Programming 

I have created separate project for each section.
I have added the classes according to the scope of the question.

Section A:
1a). Add sing() method in Bird class. We can do unit test for Solution class and make sure when sing() method is called, it prints “I am singing”. Also we can write JUNIT testcases and can use assertion for testing.
1b). The first method is not maintainable and also it is not optimized . So to solve this, we have to create an animal abstract class and can make sing() and fly() method as abstract.
